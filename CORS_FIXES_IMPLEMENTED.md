# CORS Fixes Implemented

## Problem
Your frontend at `https://fullstack-seven-navy.vercel.app` was getting CORS errors when trying to access the appointments API at `https://fullstack-mungai-42s-projects.vercel.app/api/appointments`.

## Root Cause
The domain `https://fullstack-seven-navy.vercel.app` was not included in the allowed origins list in your CORS configuration.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Updated `api/index.js`
- Added `https://fullstack-seven-navy.vercel.app` to the CORS allowed origins list
- Updated both the main CORS middleware and the additional CORS middleware

### 2. ✅ Updated `vercel.json`
- Added CORS headers configuration at the Vercel level
- This provides an additional layer of CORS protection

### 3. ✅ Enhanced `routes/appointments.js`
- Added route-level CORS middleware specifically for appointments
- Added OPTIONS preflight request handler
- Ensures CORS headers are set for all appointment-related requests

### 4. ✅ Created Test Files
- `test-cors.html` - A simple test page to verify CORS configuration
- `deploy-cors-fix.sh` - Deployment script for the fixes

## Files Modified

```
api/index.js                    - Added missing domain to CORS origins
vercel.json                     - Added CORS headers configuration
routes/appointments.js          - Added route-level CORS handling
test-cors.html                  - Created CORS test page
deploy-cors-fix.sh              - Created deployment script
```

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Use the Deployment Script
```bash
./deploy-cors-fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for fullstack-seven-navy.vercel.app"

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the changes** to Vercel
2. **Open `test-cors.html`** in your browser
3. **Click "Test GET /api/appointments"** to verify CORS is working
4. **Test from your frontend** at `https://fullstack-seven-navy.vercel.app`

## Expected Result

After deployment, your frontend should be able to successfully make requests to:
```
https://fullstack-mungai-42s-projects.vercel.app/api/appointments
```

## CORS Headers Now Set

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://fullstack-seven-navy.vercel.app`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: `Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, Cache-Control`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`

## Security Notes

- Only specific domains are allowed (not `*`)
- Credentials are supported for authenticated requests
- All common HTTP methods are supported
- Preflight OPTIONS requests are properly handled

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter CORS issues:

1. **Check deployment**: Ensure changes are deployed to Vercel
2. **Clear browser cache**: CORS errors can be cached
3. **Verify domain**: Double-check the exact domain in your frontend
4. **Check network tab**: Look for the actual CORS headers in the response

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fixes using the provided script
2. Test the CORS configuration
3. Verify your frontend can now access the appointments API
4. Remove the test files if no longer needed
